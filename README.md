# rate-limiter
Implementing rate limiting in `Node.js` involves controlling the number of requests that a client can make to a server within a given time period. This can help to prevent abuse, reduce server load, and ensure that all clients have equal access to server resources.

There are several ways to implement `rate limiting` in Node.js, including using third-party libraries or writing custom code. Here's an example of how to implement rate limiting using the `express-rate-limit` middleware library:

First, install the library using NPM:
```
npm install express-rate-limit
```
Then, require the library in your code and use it as middleware in your Express application:

```
const rateLimit = require("express-rate-limit");

const limiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100, // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
  message: "Too many requests from this IP, please try again in a few minutes"
});

app.use(limiter);
```
In this example, we're limiting each IP address to 100 requests per 15 minute window. If a client exceeds this limit, they'll receive a 429 HTTP response with the message "Too many requests from this IP, please try again in a few minutes".

You can customize the rate limit by changing the `windowMs` and `max` options, and the error message with the `message` option.

This is just one example of how to implement rate limiting in Node.js. There are other libraries and approaches you can use depending on your specific requirements and use case.
