# rate-limiter
A rate limiter is a software component or module that controls the number of requests a client can make to a server within a given time period. The rate limiter helps to prevent abuse, protect server resources, and ensure that all clients have equal access to those resources.

A rate limiter typically defines a limit on the number of requests that can be made by a client in a given time period, such as one request per second, or 100 requests per minute. When a client exceeds this limit, the rate limiter may delay or reject the request, or return an error code to the client.

Rate limiters can be implemented in different ways, such as using a middleware in a web server, a library in an application, or a proxy in front of a server. They are commonly used in web APIs, web servers, and distributed systems to prevent excessive usage, protect against denial of service attacks, and maintain stability and availability.

Some rate limiters may use a sliding window approach to adjust the limit based on the recent history of requests, while others may use a token bucket or leaky bucket algorithm to smooth out the request rate over time.

Overall, rate limiters are an important tool for controlling the flow of requests to a server or a service, and for ensuring fair and reliable access to resources.

Implementing rate limiting in `Node.js` involves controlling the number of requests that a client can make to a server within a given time period. This can help to prevent abuse, reduce server load, and ensure that all clients have equal access to server resources.

There are several ways to implement `rate limiting` in Node.js, including using third-party libraries or writing custom code. Here's an example of how to implement rate limiting using the `express-rate-limit` middleware library:

First, install the library using NPM:
```
npm install express-rate-limit
```
Then, require the library in your code and use it as middleware in your Express application:

```
const rateLimit = require("express-rate-limit");

const limiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100, // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
  message: "Too many requests from this IP, please try again in a few minutes"
});

app.use(limiter);
```
In this example, we're limiting each IP address to 100 requests per 15 minute window. If a client exceeds this limit, they'll receive a 429 HTTP response with the message "Too many requests from this IP, please try again in a few minutes".

You can customize the rate limit by changing the `windowMs` and `max` options, and the error message with the `message` option.

This is just one example of how to implement rate limiting in Node.js. There are other libraries and approaches you can use depending on your specific requirements and use case.
